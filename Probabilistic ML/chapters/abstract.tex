\chapter*{Abstract}

As a student of Scientific and Data Intensive Computing, I've created these notes while attending the \textbf{Probabilistic Machine Learning} course.

\vspace{1em}

This course will cover the "\textit{probabilistic side}" of machine learning. In particular, we will focus on the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Basics of probability and probabilistic inference
    \item Pronabilistic formulation of learning (Empirical Risk Minimization and PAC  Learning)
    \item Graphical Models
    \item Inference with graphical models: belief propagation
    \item Hidden Markov Models for sequential data
    \item Bayesian Linear Regression and Classification, Laplace approximation, Model Selection
    \item Kernel Regression and Kernel functions, Gaussian Processes for regression (hints)
    \item Monte Carlo sampling
    \item Expectation Maximization and Variational Inference
    \item Bayesian Neural Networks
    \item Generative Modelling: Variational Autoencoders and Diffusion Processes
\end{itemize}

While these notes were primarily created for my personal study, they may serve as a valuable resource for fellow students and professionals interested in probabilistic machine learning.
