\chapter{Missing notes}

\begin{warningblock}[Missing notes]
    Here there should be notes about:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Some usage examples of both Itô and Stratonovich SDEs.
        \item The relationship between the Itô and Stratonovich SDEs.
        \item NIT examples.
        \item Bounded noises.
    \end{itemize}
    I don't have time now so I'll skip them to go ahead with Markov chains.
\end{warningblock}

Look at \cref{ch:raw} for raw notes.
