\chapter*{Abstract}

As a student of Scientific and Data Intensive Computing, I've created these notes while attending the \textbf{Stochastic Modeling and Simulation} course.

The course covers a wide range of topics, including Stochastic Nonlinear Models in different application fields (as physics, biomedicine, mathematics, ...), Stochastic Differential Equations, and Stochastic Simulation.

The topics covered in these notes include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Recap of Deterministic Models
\item Stochastic Differential Equations and White Noise
\item Fokker Planck Equation
\item Noise-induced Transitions
\item Colored noises
\item Bounded Stochastic Processes
\item Spatio-temporal Stochastic Processes
\item Parameter Estimation form Data
\item Stochasticity \dots
\item \dots
\item Continuous state space-discrete time Stochastic Processes
\item Discrete Time Markov Chains
\item Continuous Time Markov Chains
\item Mean Field Approximation
\end{itemize}

While these notes were primarily created for my personal study, they may serve as a valuable resource for fellow students and professionals interested in Stochastic Modeling and Simulation.
