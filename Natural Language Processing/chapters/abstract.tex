\chapter*{Preface}

As a student of Artificial Intelligence, I've created these notes while attending the \textbf{Natural Language Processing} course.

The course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of natural language processing, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications. The notes encompass a variety of topics, which are divided in three main blocks:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Introduction to computational linguistics and natural language processing
    \item Architectures for written-text processing
    \item Architectures for speech
\end{enumerate}

While these notes were primarily created for my personal study, they may serve as a valuable resource for fellow students and professionals interested in natural language processing.
