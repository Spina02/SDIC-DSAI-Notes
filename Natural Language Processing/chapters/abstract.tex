\chapter*{Preface}

As a student of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, I've created these notes while attending the \textbf{Natural Language Processing} course.

The course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of natural language processing, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications. The notes encompass a variety of topics, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item ML and DL Fundamentals
    \item Tokenization and Text Preprocessing
    \item Word Embeddings
    \item RNN for NLP
    \item Transformers and Attention Mechanisms
    \item Language Models (e.g., BERT, GPT)
    \item Understanding LLMs
    \item Visutal Language Models
\end{itemize}

While these notes were primarily created for my personal study, they may serve as a valuable resource for fellow students and professionals interested in natural language processing.
