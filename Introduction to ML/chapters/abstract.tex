\section*{Abstract}

As a student of the \curlyquotes{Data Science and Artificial Intelligence} master's degree at the University of Trieste, I have created these notes to study the course \curlyquotes{Introduction to Machine Learning} held by Prof. Eric Medvet. The course aims to provide an introduction to the field of machine learning, covering the fundamental concepts in theoretical terms.
The topics are the followig:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Supervised learning techniques
    \item Unsupervised learning techniques
    \item Dimensionality reduction (not covered in the lectures)
    \item Introduction to NLP
\end{itemize}
While these notes were primarily created for my personal study, they may serve as a valuable resource for fellow students and professionals interested in this field.
