This book is a summary of the lectures given in the cource "Reinforcement Learning" by professor Antonio Celani at the University of Trieste, along with the referenced book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Sutton and Barto. The course is part of the Master's degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Trieste, in which I am currently enrolled. This 

While these notes were primarily created for my personal study, they may serve as a valuable resource for fellow students and professionals interested in reinforcement learning.

The content focuses on both theoretical foundations and practical implementations, documenting the challenges and solutions I've encountered while learning these advanced concepts. My goal in sharing these notes is to provide a practical perspective on reinforcement learning from a student's point of view, hopefully making these complex topics more approachable for others who are on a similar learning path.
