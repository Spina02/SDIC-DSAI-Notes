\chapter*{Preface}

As a student of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, I've created these notes while attending the \textbf{Computer Vision} course.

The course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of computer vision, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications. The notes encompass a variety of topics, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fundamental principles of image processing and analysis.
    \item Techniques for feature detection and extraction.
    \item Methods for object recognition and classification.
    \item An overview of deep learning approaches in computer vision.
    \item Practical implementations using \plaintt{OpenCV}.
\end{itemize}

While these notes were primarily created for my personal study, they may serve as a valuable resource for fellow students and professionals interested in computer vision.
