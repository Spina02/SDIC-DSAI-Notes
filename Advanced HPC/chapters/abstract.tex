\chapter*{Preface}

In this course, we will explore a set of fundamental topics essential for high-performance and parallel computing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vectorization}: methods for processing multiple data elements at once to fully utilize modern CPU architectures.
    \item \textbf{OpenMP}: a popular interface for developing shared-memory parallel programs that allows straightforward multi-threading.
    \item \textbf{GPU}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[--] \textbf{cuda}: NVIDIA's platform and API for general-purpose computing on GPUs.
        \item[--] \textbf{openacc}: a directive-based standard for simplifying the acceleration of code on GPUs and other devices.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MPI}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[--] \textbf{Data-Types}: constructing and efficiently communicating custom and built-in datatypes in distributed environments.
        \item[--] \textbf{I/O}: strategies and tools for performing parallel input and output in large-scale applications.
        \item[--] \textbf{one-sided communication}: advanced features for direct remote memory access and asynchronous messaging.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MPI in python}: using the Message Passing Interface within the Python ecosystem for approachable and flexible parallel programming.
\end{itemize}
