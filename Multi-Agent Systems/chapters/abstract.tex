\chapter*{Preface}

As a student of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, I've created these notes while attending the \textbf{Multi-Agent Systems} course.

The course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of multi-agent systems, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications. The notes encompass a variety of topics, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Intelligent Agents and Multi-Agent Systems
    \item Communication in Multi-Agent Systems
    \item Interacting by Cooperating
    \item Competition and Negotiation
    \item Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)
    \item Learning in Multi-Agent Systems
    \item Bio-inspired Systems and Swarm Intelligence
    \item ABM Analysis
\end{itemize}

While these notes were primarily created for my personal study, they may serve as a valuable resource for fellow students and professionals interested in multi-agent systems.
