\chapter*{Preface}

As a student in the "Data Science and Artificial Intelligence" master's program at the University of Trieste, I have compiled these notes to support my study of the course "Global and Multi-Objective Optimisation." The aim is to provide a clear and structured summary of the key concepts, algorithms, and methodologies covered throughout the course, both for my own understanding and as a resource for fellow students and anyone interested in this field.

These notes cover a broad spectrum of topics, beginning with the fundamentals of optimization and progressing through the main families of evolutionary and bio-inspired algorithms, including Genetic Algorithms, Evolution Strategies, Genetic Programming, and their modern extensions. Special attention is given to advanced topics such as Estimation of Distribution Algorithms, Geometric Semantic GP, Covariance Matrix Adaptation, distributed and coevolutionary methods, policy optimization, multi-objective optimization, and neuroevolution.

While primarily intended as a personal study aid, I hope these notes will also prove useful to others seeking a concise yet comprehensive introduction to modern global and multi-objective optimization techniques.
