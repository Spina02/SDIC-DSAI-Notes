\chapter*{Preface}

As a student of Scientific and Data Intensive Computing, I've created these notes while attending the \textbf{High Performance Computing} module of \textbf{High Performance and Cloude Computing} course.

The course will introduce the fundamentals of High Performance Computing, exploring both its concepts and practical applications. The notes cover a wide range of topics, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item An overview of High Performance Computing and its importance in solving complex, real-world problems.
    \item The principles behind modern computer architectures and how they influence performance.
    \item Essential tools and techniques for parallel programming, alongside strategies to optimize code for advanced architectures.
    \item The evolution of computing facilities and how to effectively leverage them for large-scale computational challenges.
    \item Developing a proactive mindset, moving beyond the use of pre-packaged tools to a deeper understanding of the underlying systems.
\end{itemize}
    
While these notes were primarily created for my personal study, they may serve as a valuable resource for fellow students and professionals interested in High Performance Computing.
