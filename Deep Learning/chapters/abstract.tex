\chapter*{Preface}

As a student of Scientific and Data Intensive Computing, I've created these notes while attending the \textbf{Deep Learning} course.

The prerequisites of the course are basic knowledge of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Linear Algebra (eigenvalue problems, SVD, etc.)
    \item Mathematical Analysis (multivariate differential calculus, etc.)
    \item Probability (chain rule, Bayes theorem, etc.)
    \item Machine Learning (logistic regression, PCA, etc.)
    \item Programming (Python, Linux Shell, etc.)
\end{itemize}

While these notes were primarily created for my personal study, they may serve as a valuable resource for fellow students and professionals interested in Deep Learning.
