\chapter*{Abstract}

As a student of Scientific and Data Intensive Computing, I've created these notes while attending the \textbf{Deep Learning} course

While these notes were primarily created for my personal study, they may serve as a valuable resource for fellow students and professionals interested in Deep Learning.

The content focuses on both theoretical foundations and practical implementations, documenting the challenges and solutions I've encountered while learning these advanced concepts. My goal in sharing these notes is to provide a practical perspective on deep learning from a student's point of view, hopefully making these complex topics more approachable for others who are on a similar learning path.
