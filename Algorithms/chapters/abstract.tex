\chapter*{Preface}

As a student of the \curlyquotes{Data Science and Artificial Intelligence} master's degree at the University of Trieste, I have created these notes to study the course \curlyquotes{Algorithmic Design} held by Prof. Giulia Bernardini. The course aims to provide students with a solid foundation in designing algorithms, analyzing their complexity, and understanding their applications in various domains.
The course covers the following topics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Basics
    \item Sorting Algorithms
    \item Searching Algorithms
\end{itemize}
Note that this is only the first part of the course.

While these notes were primarily created for my personal study, they may serve as a valuable resource for fellow students and professionals interested in this field.
