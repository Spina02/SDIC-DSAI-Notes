\chapter{Unix Shell}

\section{What is a Shell?}

The shell is the primary interface between users and the computer's core system. When you type commands in a terminal, the shell interprets these instructions and communicates with the operating system to execute them. It serves as a crucial layer that makes complex system operations accessible through simple text commands.

\begin{definitionblock}[Shell]
    A shell is a program that provides the traditional, text-only user interface for Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems. Its primary function is to read commands that are typed into a console […] and then execute (i.e., run) them. The term shell derives its name from the fact that it is an outer layer of an operating system. A shell is an interface between the user and the internal parts of the OS (at the very core of which is the kernel).

\subsection{Types of shell}

Over time, various shells have evolved to meet different needs. The most widely used is \texttt{Bash} (Bourne Again Shell), named after its creator Stephen Bourne. It's the go-to shell for most Linux systems, serving both as a command interpreter and scripting language.
Notably, macOS switched to \texttt{zsh} (Bash-compatible) from Catalina onward, while other alternatives include \texttt{Fish}, \texttt{ksh}, and \texttt{PowerShell}.

\begin{tipsblock}[Changing the Shell]
    The shell might be changed by simply typing its name and even the default shell might be changed for all sessions.
\end{tipsblock}

\subsubsection{Login vs. Non-login Shell}

A \textbf{login shell} is invoked when a user logs into the system (e.g., through a virtual terminal by pressing \texttt{Ctrl+Alt+F1}). It requires the user to provide a username and password. Once authenticated, the user is presented with an interactive shell session. Login shells are typically the first point of interaction between a user and the system.

A \textbf{non-login shell}, on the other hand, does not require the user to log in again, as it is executed within an already active user session. For example, opening a graphical terminal in a desktop environment provides a non-login (interactive) shell. Non-login shells are commonly used in environments where the user is already authenticated.

\subsubsection{Interactive vs. Non-interactive Shell}

An \textbf{interactive shell} allows users to type commands and receive immediate feedback. Both login and non-login shells can be interactive. Examples include graphical terminals and virtual terminals. In interactive shells, the prompt (\texttt{\$PS1}) must be set, which provides the user interface for command input.
A \textbf{non-interactive shell}, however, is typically executed in automated environments, such as scripts or batch processes. Input and output are generally hidden unless explicitly managed by the calling process. Non-interactive shells are usually non-login shells since the user is already authenticated. For instance, when a script is executed, it runs in a non-interactive shell. However, scripts can emulate interactivity by prompting users for input.

\section{Shell Scripting}

\subsection{Variables and Environmental Variables}

Shells, like any program, use variables to store data. Variables are assigned values using the equals sign (\texttt{=}) without spaces. For example, to assign the value \texttt{1} to the variable \texttt{A}, one would type:

\begin{codeblock}[language=bash, numbers=none]
A=1
\end{codeblock}

To retrieve a variable's value, the dollar sign (\texttt{\$}) and curly braces are used. For example:

\begin{codeblock}[language=bash, numbers=none]
echo ${A}
\end{codeblock}

Certain variables, called \textbf{environmental variables}, influence how processes run on the system. These variables are often predefined. For instance, to display the user’s home directory, use: \texttt{echo \$\{HOME\}}. To create an environmental variable, prepend the command \texttt{export}.

\begin{exampleblock}[Setting the PATH]
    For example, to add \plaintt{/usr/sbin} to the \plaintt{PATH} environmental variable:
    \begin{codeblock}[language=bash, numbers=none]
export PATH="/usr/sbin:$PATH"
    \end{codeblock}
\end{exampleblock}

The \texttt{PATH} variable specifies directories where executable programs are located, ensuring commands can be executed without specifying full paths.

When a terminal is launched, the UNIX system invokes the shell interpreter specified in the \texttt{SHELL} environment variable. If \texttt{SHELL} is unset, the system default is used. After sourcing initialization files, the shell presents the prompt, which is defined by the \texttt{\$PS1} environment variable.

\subsection{Initialization Files}

Initialization files are scripts or configuration files executed when a shell session starts. They set up the shell environment, define default settings, and customize behavior. Depending on the type of shell (login, non-login, interactive, or non-interactive), different initialization files are sourced.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Login Shell Initialization Files}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Bourne-compatible shells: \texttt{/etc/profile}, \texttt{/etc/profile.d/*}, \texttt{\textasciitilde/.profile}.
        \item Bash: \texttt{\textasciitilde/.bash\_profile} (or \texttt{\textasciitilde/.bash\_login}).
        \item zsh: \texttt{/etc/zprofile}, \texttt{\textasciitilde/.zprofile}.
        \item csh: \texttt{/etc/csh.login}, \texttt{\textasciitilde/.login}.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Non-login Shell Initialization Files}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Bash: \texttt{/etc/bash.bashrc}, \texttt{\textasciitilde/.bashrc}.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Interactive Shell Initialization Files}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{/etc/profile}, \texttt{/etc/profile.d/*}, and \texttt{\textasciitilde/.profile}.
        \item For Bash: \texttt{/etc/bash.bashrc} and \texttt{\textasciitilde/.bashrc}.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Non-interactive Shell Initialization Files}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For Bash: \texttt{/etc/bash.bashrc}. 
        
        However, most scripts begin with the condition \texttt{[ -z "\$PS1" ] \&\& return}.
        This means that if the shell is non-interactive (as indicated by the absence of the \texttt{\$PS1} prompt variable), the script stops execution immediately.
        
        \item Depending on the shell, the file specified in the \texttt{\$ENV} (or \texttt{\$BASH\_ENV}) environment variable may also be read.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Basic Shell Commands}

To become familiar with the shell, let’s start with some fundamental commands:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{echo}: Prints the text or variable values you provide at the shell prompt.
    \item \texttt{date}: Displays the current date and time.
    \item \texttt{clear}: Clears the terminal screen.
    \item \texttt{pwd}: Stands for \textit{Print Working Directory}, showing the current directory the shell is operating in. It is also the default location where commands look for files.
    \item \texttt{ls}: Stands for \textit{List}, and lists the contents of the current directory.
    \item \texttt{cd}: Stands for \textit{Change Directory}, and switches the current directory to the specified path.
    \item \texttt{cp}: Stands for \textit{Copy}, and duplicates files or directories from a source to a destination.
    \item \texttt{mv}: Stands for \textit{Move}, and transfers files or directories from one location to another. It can also rename files.
    \item \texttt{touch}: Creates a new, empty file or updates the timestamps of an existing file.
    \item \texttt{mkdir}: Stands for \textit{Make Directory}, and creates new directories.
    \item \texttt{rm}: Stands for \textit{Remove}, and deletes files or directories. To delete directories, the recursive option (\texttt{-r}) must be used.
\end{itemize}

\begin{warningblock}[Remove Command]
    Be cautious when using the \plaintt{rm} command, as it permanently deletes files and directories \textbf{without moving them to the trash}.
\end{warningblock}

\subsection{Shell Scripts}

Commands can be written in a script file, which is a text file containing instructions for the shell to execute. 
The first line of the script, known as the \textbf{shebang}, specifies the interpreter to use.

\begin{codeblock}[language=bash, numbers=none]
#!/bin/bash
#!/usr/bin/env python
\end{codeblock}

To make a script executable, you need to change its permissions:
\texttt{chmod +x script\_file}

\subsubsection{Not All Commands Are the Same}

Commands in the shell can behave differently depending on how they are executed. For example, when a command like \texttt{ls} is run, it creates a \textbf{subprocess}, a separate instance that inherits the environment of the parent shell. This subprocess runs the command and then terminates, returning control to the parent shell.

\begin{tipsblock}[Running Commands]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Subprocess}: Subprocesses can't modify the parent shell's environment or state. Changes made in subprocesses don't persist.
        \item \textbf{\plaintt{source}}: The \plaintt{source} command \ (or \plaintt{.}) \ runs scripts in the current shell context, allowing environment modifications.
        \item \textbf{Scripts}: Running with \plaintt{./script\_file} creates a subprocess, isolating effects from the parent shell.
    \end{itemize}
\end{tipsblock}

\subsubsection{Types of Commands}

In the shell, commands can fall into several categories:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Built-in Commands}: These are commands provided directly by the shell, such as \texttt{cd}, that are executed without creating a subprocess, necessary to update environment variables.
    \item \textbf{Executables}: These are standalone programs stored in directories specified by the \texttt{\$PATH} environment variable. Examples include \texttt{ls}, \texttt{grep}, and \texttt{find}.
    \item \textbf{Functions and Aliases}: These are user-defined commands or shortcuts, often configured in initialization files like \texttt{\textasciitilde/.bashrc}.
\end{itemize}

To determine the type of a command and its location you can use:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{type command\_name} to identify if the command is built-in, an executable, or a function/alias.
    \item \texttt{which command\_name} to find the exact location of an executable in the file system.
\end{itemize}

\begin{warningblock}[Spaces in File Names]
    Avoid using spaces or accented characters in file names. Instead, use:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \plaintt{my\_file\_name} (snake case),
        \item \plaintt{myFileName} (camel case),
        \item \plaintt{my-file-name} (kebab case).
    \end{itemize}
    Spaces complicate scripts and make parsing error-prone.
\end{warningblock}

\newpage

\subsection{Functions}

A \textbf{function} in a shell script is a reusable block of code. The syntax is:
\begin{codeblock}[language=bash]
function_name() {
    # Commands to execute
}
\end{codeblock}

\vspace{-0.3em}

Scripts or functions can access \textbf{input arguments} passed to them using special variables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{\$0}: The name of the script or function.
    \item \texttt{\$1}, \texttt{\$2}, \texttt{\$3}, etc.: The first, second, third, etc., arguments.
    \item \texttt{\$\#}: The number of arguments passed.
    \item \texttt{\$@}: All arguments as separate words.
    \item \texttt{\$*}: All arguments as a single word (rarely used).
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}[Function that prints the sum of two numbers]
    \begin{codeblock}[language=bash]
sum() {
    echo $(($1 + $2))
}
    \end{codeblock}
\end{exampleblock}

\vspace{-0.5em}

\subsection{Additional Shell Commands}
\vspace{-0.3em}

\subsubsection{More Commands}
\vspace{-0.3em}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{cat}: \textit{Concatenate}. Reads and outputs the contents of files. It can read multiple files and concatenate their content.
    \item \texttt{wc}: \textit{Word Count}. Provides statistics like newline, word and byte count for a list of files.
    \item \texttt{grep}: \textit{Global Regular Expression Print}. Searches for lines containing a specific string or matching a given pattern.
    \item \texttt{head}: Displays the first few lines of a file.
    \item \texttt{tail}: Displays the last few lines of a file.
    \item \texttt{file}: Examines specified files to determine their type.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Redirection, Pipelines, and Filters}
\vspace{-0.3em}

Commands can be combined using operators to manipulate input and output streams:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{pipe operator} (\texttt{|}) forwards the output of one command to another.
    
    Example: \texttt{cat /etc/passwd | grep <word>} filters system information for a specific word.
    
    \item The \textbf{redirect operator} (\texttt{>}) sends the standard output to a file.
    
    Example: \texttt{ls > files-in-this-folder.txt}.
    
    \item The \textbf{append operator} (\texttt{>>}) appends output to an existing file.
    \item The \textbf{operator} (\texttt{\&>}) redirects both standard output and standard error to a file.
    \item \textbf{Logical operators}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{\&\&}: Executes the next command only if the previous one succeeds.
        \item \texttt{||}: Executes the next command only if the previous one fails.
        \item \texttt{;}: Executes commands sequentially, regardless of the status of the previous command.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \texttt{\$?}: Contains the exit status of the last command.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Quoting in Shell}

Quoting affects how strings and variables are interpreted:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{""}: Double quotes interpret variables.
    \item \texttt{''}: Single quotes treat everything as literal.
\end{itemize}

\begin{codeblock}[language=bash]
a=yes
echo "$a" # Outputs "yes".
echo '$a' # Outputs "$a".
\end{codeblock}

The output of a command can be converted into a string and assigned to a variable for later reuse: 

\begin{codeblock}[language=bash, numbers=none]
list=$(ls -l)$
# or equivalently:
list=`ls -l`
\end{codeblock}

\subsubsection{Processes}

Managing background and foreground processes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{./my\_command \&}: Run a command in the background.
    \item \texttt{Ctrl-Z}: Suspend the current process.
    \item \texttt{jobs}: List background processes.
    \item \texttt{bg \%n}: Resume a suspended process in the background.
    \item \texttt{fg \%n}: Bring a background process to the foreground.
    \item \texttt{Ctrl-C}: Terminate the foreground process.
    \item \texttt{kill pid}: Send a termination signal to a process.
    \item \texttt{ps aux | grep process}: Find running processes.
\end{itemize}

Processes in the background are terminated when the terminal closes unless started with \texttt{nohup}.

\begin{tipsblock}[How to Get Help]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \plaintt{command -h} or \plaintt{command --help}: Display a brief help message.
        \item \plaintt{man command}: Access the manual for the command.
        \item \plaintt{info command}: Show detailed information (if available).

\section{Git introduction}

\href{https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=workspace}{Git Cheatsheet}

Version control is the practice of tracking and managing the changes in the software code. \texttt{Git} is an open-source version control system, 
which helps teams manage changes to the source code over time. It is \textbf{distributed}, that is, every developer has the full history of their code repository locally.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{assets/git.png}
    \caption{Git Cheatsheet}
    \label{fig:git_cs}
\end{figure}

Basic Git commands:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{git init}: Initialize a new Git repository.
    \item \texttt{git clone <url>}: Clone a repository from a URL.
    \item \texttt{git status}: Show the status of the working directory.
    \item \texttt{git add <file>}: Add a file to the staging area.
    \item \texttt{git commit -m "message"}: Commit changes to the repository.
    \item \texttt{git push origin <branch>}: Push changes to a remote repository.
    \item \texttt{git pull origin <branch>}: Pull changes from a remote repository.
    \item \texttt{git branch}: List all branches in the repository.
    \item \texttt{git checkout <branch>}: Switch to a different branch.
    \item \texttt{git merge <branch>}: Merge changes from a branch into the current branch.
    \item \texttt{git log}: Show the commit history.
\end{itemize}



To collaborate, just remember to pull the changes made by your colleagues before pushing your own changes. If you are working on the same files, the best practice is to create a new \textbf{branch},
such that you can merge the changes only when you are sure that everything works as expected.

When you create a branch, Git basically adds a new pointer to the latest commit. This pointer moves forward as you add new commits. 
When you switch branches, Git moves the pointer to the latest commit of the branch you are switching to.
When you merge branches, Git combines the changes of the two branches and moves the pointer to the latest commit of the merged branches. If it encounters some conflics, it will ask you to solve them.
Rebasing allow you to move the commits of a branch on top of another branch, so that the history is linear.

Best practices:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Commit often, with meaningful messages.
    \item Use branches to isolate changes.
    \item Pull before pushing.
    \item Write tests for your code.
    \item Use a \texttt{.gitignore} file to exclude files from version control.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SSH Authentication}

To avoid typing your username and password every time you push or pull from a repository, you can use SSH keys for authentication.

\begin{tipsblock}[SSH Keys]
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Generate a new SSH key: \plaintt{ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your\@email"}.
        \item Add the SSH key to the SSH agent: \newline \plaintt{eval "\$(ssh-agent -s)"; ssh-add \textasciitilde/.ssh/id\_rsa}.
        \item Add the SSH key to your Git account.
        \item Test the SSH connection: \plaintt{ssh -T}
        \item Change the remote URL to the SSH URL: \plaintt{git remote set-url origin}
        \item Test the connection: \plaintt{git pull}.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tipsblock}
