\chapter*{Preface}

As a student of the \curlyquotes{Data Science and Artificial Intelligence} master's degree at the University of Trieste, I have created these notes to study the course \curlyquotes{Advanced Programming} held by Prof. Pasquale Claudio Africa. The course aims to provide students with a solid foundation in programming, focusing on the C++ programming language. The course covers the following topics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bash scripting
    \item C++ basics
    \item Object-oriented programming
    \item Templates
    \item Standard Template Library (STL)
    \item Libraries
    \item Makefile
    \item CMake
    \item C++11/14/17/20 features
    \item Integration with Python
    \item Parallel programming (not covered in the lectures but useful for the HPC course)
\end{itemize}
While these notes were primarily created for my personal study, they may serve as a valuable resource for fellow students and professionals interested in this field.
